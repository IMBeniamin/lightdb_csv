# lightdb_csv
A very basic modular implementation of a database that stores and reads data from/to csv

This idea is based on an assigned school project.
Even thought the project currently only works with a limited csv template file it aims to be fully dynamic and have full support for creation and deletion of custom tables and templates.

I aim to have a basic implementation of all the base functionalities on the current csv data structure template and afterwards proceed to make the software fully modular.
This project might be migrated to a secondary branch and the master will be reserved for the fully modular and dynamic database.

I have very little experience in C and this is a training project, therefore all constructive criticism is appreciated and taken into consideration.
